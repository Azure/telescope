# Telescope

This repository is part of the Cloud Competitve Test Framework that enables engineers and product managers to efficiently analyze and compare features, reproduce (customer reported) issues, and evaluate performance across the three major cloud providers: Azure, AWS, and GCP. This framework makes it easy to conduct seamless and accurate assessments within the compute, network, and storage domains. It stores test scenarios specific code, include terraform code for creating and managing infrastructure as code and python/bash code for test modules (e.g. iperf, jmeter, fio) integration.

Note:
- Here * represents these folders are required for to create any tests using this framework.

### .github

This directory contains GitHub workflows, which automate various tasks like unit testing and validating the code.

- **workflows**: This folder Contains YAML files defining GitHub Actions.

### modules

This directory holds reusable scripts and configurations for automation tasks.

- **bash**: Contains Bash scripts for various automation tasks related to specifc to test scenario's and cloud.
- **python**: Contains Python scripts/modules for running various test scenario's.
- **terraform**: Contains Terraform configurations for managing cloud infrastructure related to AWS and Azure.

  - **aws**: Terraform module configurations specific to Amazon Web Services (AWS).
  - **azure**: Terraform module configurations specific to Microsoft Azure.

Note:
  - Please refer to this [Terraform Readme](./modules/terraform/README.md) to know about the modules we currently support for telescope framework.

### scenarios

This directory organizes different test scenarios inputs to evaluation the performance of different cloud components and reproduce issues we see in production.

- **issue-repo**: Contains test scenarios related to know issues that can to be replicated using telescope framework.
  Example:
  - **lb-tls-error**: Name of the issue we are trying to reproduce.

    - **bash-scripts**: Bash scripts for diagnosing or replicating TLS errors.
    - **https**: Files related to HTTPS configuration.

## Create and run Test Scenarios

### Test Scenarios

* All existing test scenarios are located in the [Scenarios](https://github.com/Azure/telescope/tree/main/scenarios) folder.

### Build a new test scenario

#### Main workflows

* Step 1: Create a test branch with new test scenario(vm-diff-zone-iperf) in [Azure/telescope](https://github.com/Azure/telescope/tree/main/scenarios) repository.
* Step 2: Create new folder under `scenarios\perf-eval\`  with `vm-diff-zone-iperf` and create subfolders terraform-inputs and terraform-test-inputs which are required for any test scenario.
* Step 3: Create aws.tfvars and azure.tfvars files inside terraform-inputs folder.
* Step 4: Create azure.json and aws.json files inside terraform-test-inputs folder.

Please find the templates for these files below:

  **Note:**
  - In this json files we add key values that are passed as arguments while running terraform apply.
  - In this template all the values are required for any test scenario.
  - We can additional inputs to this template which are optional and varies based on the test setup.

**Aws json Template:**

```json
{
    "owner"         : "terraform_unit_tests",  // Owner of the resource (e.g., "terraform_unit_tests")
    "run_id"        : "123456789",  // Run ID associated with the resource (e.g., "123456789")
    "region"        : "us-east-1",  // AWS region where the resource is located (e.g., "us-east-1")
    "machine_type"  : "m5.4xlarge"  // Type of machine used  (e.g., "m5.4xlarge")
}
```

* Step 5: Follow the instructions from this [readme](./scenarios/perf-eval/vm-iperf/README.md) and manually run the terraform code on your local machine.
* Step 6: After testing it successfull on your local machine. Push the changes to remote branch.
* Step 7: Create a new pull request to merge the github changes to the main branch.
* Step 8: Once the GitHub PR is merged. Create a GitHub tag based on the changes you added in this PR. Please refer to the Tag documentation below to create the tag.

### Update an existing test scenario

* Step 1: Create a test branch in [Azure/telescope](https://github.com/Azure/telescope/tree/main/scenarios) repository.
* Step 2: Navigate to the test scenario file you want to update and make the necessary changes. You can coordinate using `SCENARIO_TYPE` and `SCENARIO_NAME` to find the corresponding test scenario folder.

For example, if you want to update the `lb-same-zone-iperf` test scenario, then you should navigate to the [lb-same-zone-iperf](https://github.com/Azure/telescope/tree/main/scenarios/perf-eval/lb-same-zone-iperf) folder and make necessary changes.
* Step 3: Manually run the terrafrom code on your local machine and test your changes.
* Step 4: Once the changes are verified create PR and update the tag version.

### CI checks

We currently have 4 CI checks in place for GitHub Workflows:

* [Terraform Validate](https://github.com/Azure/telescope/actions/workflows/terraform-validate.yml): this one performs a dry run of the terraform code to validate that the `hcl` format and syntax is correct. It's triggered automatically when a PR is created or updated based on the changes in the PR.
  * To run the local format check run  this command `terraform fmt --check -recursive --diff`
  * To run local validation check run this command in respective terraform cloud modules folders 
    ```
    terraform init
    terraform validate
    ```
* [Terraform Plan](https://github.com/Azure/telescope/blob/main/.github/workflows/terraform-plan.yml): This workflow creates terraform plan for all the tests scenarios to make sure all terraform inputs are provided properly and check all required inputs for a test scenario. It's triggered automatically when a PR is created or updated based on the test scenario changes in the PR.
* [Python Unit Tests](https://github.com/Azure/telescope/actions/workflows/python-unit-tests.yml): this one runs the unit tests for all `py` related files to make sure python code is tested and validated. It's triggered automatically when a PR is created or updated based on the changes in the PR.
  * To run the tests locally, you can run the `python -m unittest discover` command in the python module folder of the repository.
* [Lint Checker](https://github.com/Azure/telescope/actions/workflows/code-format-validation.yml): This workflow checks for terraform lint errors and also check if the scenario folder name is not greater than 30 characters long.
  * Use these command to setup tflint on local machine.
      ```bash
      curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terraform-linters/tflint/master/install_linux.sh | bash
      tflint --init
      tflint --recursive --config "$(pwd)/.tflint.hcl"  --minimum-failure-severity=warning
      ```
  * To fix terraform lint errors that are fixable use this command `tflint --recursive --config "$(pwd)/.tflint.hcl" --fix`

# GitHub tag Scenarios:
- Sample github tag looks like this v1.0.33 which represents Version MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- Github changes are categorized in three types.
  1. Major
  2. Minor
  3. Patch
- Please check the current version used and increment the tag version based on the following scenarios.

## Current Tag version

| Current Version   | Major | Minor | Patch |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| v1.0.33           | 1     | 0     | 33    |


## Update Tag version based on the code changes
| Code Changes                   | Major | Minor | Patch | Current Tag | Updated Tag
|----------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Major Refactoring(Terraform)|&check;|&cross;|&cross;| v1.2.33|v2.0.0|
| Specific Test Scenario    |&cross;|&cross;|&check;| v2.0.1|v2.0.2|
| Engine-related Changes(Iperf,Jmeter)   |&cross;|&check;|&cross;| v1.1.1|v1.2.0|
| Results data format updated |&cross;|&check;|&cross;| v2.2.0|v2.3.0|
| Results data format remains same|&cross;|&cross;|&check;|v2.2.1|v2.2.2|
| Interface change |&cross;|&check;|&cross;|v2.3.5|v2.4.0|

Note:
 - Tags displayed in the above table are examples.
 - All the GitHub Version tags are found [here](https://github.com/Azure/telescope/tags)

## Modify properties in JSON schema:
To Modify the AWS and Azure input JSON schema, follow these steps:

- [AWS-Schema](./modules/terraform/aws/aws_input_schema.json) 
- [Azure-Schema](./modules/terraform/azure/azure_input_schema.json)

1. Use schemas referenced above to Add or modify necessary properties in the JSON schema file.
2. Update the schema whenever there is change in input json
3. Make sure to include unit tests for updated changes.
