# Telescope

Telescope is a framework built to test and compare cloud products and services, focusing on evaluating scalability and performance. It enables users to make informed, data-driven decisions for their multi-cloud strategies on Azure, AWS and GCP.

The current supported Kubernetes test scenarios are:
1. [API Server Benchmark](pipelines/perf-eval/API%20Server%20Benchmark)
2. [Autoscale Benchmark](pipelines/perf-eval/Autoscale%20Benchmark)
3. [Container Networking Benchmark](pipelines/perf-eval/CNI%20Benchmark)
4. [Container Storage Benchmark](pipelines/perf-eval/CSI%20Benchmark/)
5. Container Runtime Benchmark (incoming)

The current integrated test tools are:
1. [kperf](https://github.com/Azure/kperf/pkgs/container/kperf)
2. [clusterloader2](https://github.com/kubernetes/perf-tests/blob/master/clusterloader2/)
3. [resource-comsumer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/test/images/resource-consumer/README.md) (incoming)

## Design
![design](./docs/imgs/design.jpeg)
As the achitecture diagram above shows, Telescope streamlines the evaluation process through five key steps:

1. Provision Resources
2. Validate Resources
3. Execute Tests
4. Cleanup Resources
5. Publish Results

Telescope offers three primary reusable components:

1. **Terraform modules** to manage test resource setup and provide reproducibility.
2. **Python modules** for seamless integration with testing and measurement tools.
3. **Data Analytics** including Blob Storage, Event Hub, and Data Explorer for continuous monitoring.
