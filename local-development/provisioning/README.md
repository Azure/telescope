## Interactive Notebooks

For easy local development and testing, we provide Jupyter notebooks for each cloud provider:

- **[Azure Notebook:](./azure.ipynb)** Interactive notebook for Azure telescope testing
- **[AWS Notebook:](./aws.ipynb)** Interactive notebook for AWS telescope testing

### Quick Start with Notebooks
